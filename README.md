This is my first ever project done with React.js. it is basically composed of two components and you may say two apps. one is a simple carousel that can be used for listing the elements of an object i.e(cities: name, image, location and ...) into a carousel.

the sencond app is a simple calculator for crunching numbers. 

you can clone the repository and install the dependencies and run the app loacally.
